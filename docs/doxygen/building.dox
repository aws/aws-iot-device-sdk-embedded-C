@page building Building and Running Demos
@brief Instructions for building and running demos.

<p>
The libraries in this SDK are not dependent on any operating systems.
However, the demos for the libraries in this SDK are built and tested on a
Linux platform. This SDK builds with [CMake](https://cmake.org/), a cross-platform build tool.
</p>

@section build_prerequisites Prerequisites
@brief Prerequisites needed to run the demos.

@pre
- CMake 3.2.0 or later and a C90 compiler.

@pre
- A supported operating system. The ports provided with this repo are expected to work with all recent versions of the following operating systems, although we cannot guarantee the behavior on all systems.
    - Linux system with POSIX sockets and timer APIs. (CI tests on Ubuntu 18.04).<br>
        - On Linux systems, installation of OpenSSL development libraries and header files, <i>version 1.1.0</i> or later, are required. The OpenSSL development libraries are usually called something like `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel` when installed through a package manager.
        - Although not a part of the C90 standard, stdint.h is required for fixed-width integer types (e.g int32_t).

@section aws_iot_setup AWS IoT Account Setup
@brief Setting up AWS IoT to run demos.

It is required to setup an AWS account and access the AWS IoT Console for running demos and tests. Follow the links to:
-  [Setup an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-console-signin.html).
-  [Sign-in to the AWS IoT Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-console-signin.html) after setting up the AWS account.

@section configuring_mutual_auth_demo Configuring the Mutual Auth Demo
@brief Passing configuration settings to run the mutual auth demo.

- You can pass the following configuration settings as command line options in order to run the mutual auth demos:
@code{sh}
cmake .. -DAWS_IOT_ENDPOINT="aws-iot-endpoint" -DROOT_CA_CERT_PATH="root-ca-path" -DCLIENT_CERT_PATH="certificate-path" -DCLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="private-key-path"
@endcode

- In order to set these configurations manually, edit `demo_config.h` in `demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_mutual_auth/` to `#define` the following:

	- Set `AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT` to your custom endpoint. This is found on the *Settings* page of the AWS IoT Console and has a format of `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`.

	- Set `ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` to the path of the root CA certificate downloaded when setting up the device certificate (or Provisioning Claim for Fleet Provisioning) in [AWS IoT Account Setup](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/v4_beta#aws-iot-account-setup).

	- Set `CLIENT_CERT_PATH` to the path of the client certificate downloaded when setting up the device certificate (or Provisioning Claim for Fleet Provisioning) in [AWS IoT Account Setup](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/v4_beta#aws-iot-account-setup).

	- Set `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` to the path of the private key downloaded when setting up the device certificate (or Provisioning Claim for Fleet Provisioning) in [AWS IoT Account Setup](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/v4_beta#aws-iot-account-setup).

@section configuring_s3_demos Configuring the HTTP S3 Demos
@brief Generating pre-signed URLs and passing configuration settings to run the S3 upload, download, and multi-threaded download demos.

The S3 upload, download, and multi-threaded download demos require user-generated pre-signed URLs to be configured. A python script `presigned_url_gen.py` (located in `demos/http/common/src/`) is provided to easily generate pre-signed PUT and GET URLs.

## Using the Pre-signed URL Generator

### Dependencies
	- Python 3+
	- boto3
	- argparse

### Pre-requisites
<ol>
<li>Install the dependencies.</li>
@code{sh}
pip install boto3 argparse
@endcode

<li>You will need an AWS Account with S3 access before beginning. You must install and configure the AWS CLI in order to use this script.</li>
@code{sh}
aws configure
@endcode
	- For information on AWS S3, please see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html
	- For AWS CLI installation information, please see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html
	- For AWS CLI configuration information, please see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html
</ol>

### Usage
<ol>
<li>Run presigned_url_gen.py with your S3 **bucket-name**, S3 **object-key**, and optionally, your S3 bucket's **region-name** (if not specified, the region configured in AWS CLI will be used).</li>
@code{sh}
python presigned_urls_gen.py --bucket <YOUR BUCKET NAME> --key <YOUR OBJECT KEY> --region <YOUR BUCKET'S REGION NAME>
@endcode

An example expected output:
@code{sh}
#define S3_PRESIGNED_GET_URL    "https://aws-s3-endpoint/object-key.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ABABABABABABABABABAB%2F20201027%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201027T194726Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=SomeHash12345UrlABcdEFgfIjK"

#define S3_PRESIGNED_PUT_URL    "https://aws-s3-endpoint/object-key.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ABABABABABABABABABAB%2F20201027%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201027T194726Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=SomeHash12345UrlLMnmOPqrStUvW"
@endcode

<li>Copy and paste the output into **demo_config.h** for macro **S3_PRESIGNED_GET_URL** and **S3_PRESIGNED_PUT_URL**.</li>
@code{c}
#define S3_PRESIGNED_GET_URL    "https://aws-s3-endpoint/object-key.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ABABABABABABABABABAB%2F20201027%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201027T194726Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=SomeHash12345UrlABcdEFgfIjK"

#define S3_PRESIGNED_PUT_URL    "https://aws-s3-endpoint/object-key.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ABABABABABABABABABAB%2F20201027%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201027T194726Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=SomeHash12345UrlLMnmOPqrStUvW"
@endcode

You may also pass any or all of the following configuration settings as command line options in order to run the demos:
@code{sh}
cmake .. -DS3_PRESIGNED_GET_URL="your-get-url" -DS3_PRESIGNED_PUT_URL="your-put-url"
@endcode

Note: A pre-signed GET URL is required for all HTTP S3 demos. For upload demos, in addition to the GET URL, a pre-signed PUT URL is also required.
</ol>

### Parameter Info
	- `--bucket` : The name of the target S3 bucket used in the demos.
	- `--key` : The name of the existing object you wish to download (GET), or the name of the object you wish to upload (PUT).
	- `--region` : The name of the region in which your S3 bucket was created. If this is not passed in, the region configured in AWS CLI (or us-east-1, if not configured) will be used.

@section building_demo_commmandline Build Steps
@brief How to build the demo applications on the command-line.

- While in the root directory of AWS IoT Device SDK C, create a build directory, then change to that build directory.
@code{sh}
mkdir build && cd build
@endcode

- Run cmake while inside build directory.
@code{sh}
cmake ..
@endcode

- Run this command to build the demos.
@code{sh}
make
@endcode

<p>All demo executables can now be found in the `build/bin` directory and
should be run while inside that directory.</p>

@subsection docker_containers_for_demos Installing Docker Containers for Demos
@brief Alternative option of using Docker containers for running demos locally.

Install Docker:

@code{sh}
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

sh get-docker.sh
@endcode

#### Installing Mosquitto Broker to run MQTT demos locally

The following instructions have been tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 environment with Docker and OpenSSL installed.
<ol>
<li>Download the official Docker image for Mosquitto.</li>

@code{sh}
docker pull eclipse-mosquitto:latest
@endcode

<li>`BROKER_ENDPOINT` defined in `demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_basic_tls/demo_config.h` can now be set to `localhost`.</li>

<li>For TLS communication with Mosquitto broker, server and CA credentials need to be created. Use OpenSSL commands to generate the credentials for the Mosquitto server.</li>

- Generate CA key and certificate. Provide the Subject field information as appropriate.
@code{sh}
openssl req -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt
@endcode

- Generate server key and certificate and sign with the CA cert.
@code{sh}

openssl req -nodes -sha256 -new -keyout server.key -out server.csr

openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
@endcode

<li>Create a mosquitto.conf file to use port 8883 (for TLS communication) and providing path to the generated credentials.</li>

@code
port 8883

cafile /mosquitto/config/ca.crt
certfile /mosquitto/config/server.crt
keyfile /mosquitto/config/server.key

# Use this option for TLS mutual authentication (where client will provide CA signed certificate)
#require_certificate true
tls_version tlsv1.2
#use_identity_as_username true

@endcode

<li>Run the docker container from the local directory containing the generated credential and mosquitto.conf files.</li>

@code{sh}
docker run -it -p 8883:8883 -v $(pwd):/mosquitto/config/ --name mosquitto-basic-tls eclipse-mosquitto:latest
@endcode

<li>Set `ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` to the absolute path of the CA certificate created in step 3. for the local Mosquitto server.</li>
</ol>
