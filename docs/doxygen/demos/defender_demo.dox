@brief This demo demonstrates usage of the AWS IoT Device Defender Client library.

@section defender_demo_main AWS IoT Device Defender Demo
@brief This demo application uses the AWS IoT Device Defender Client library,
MQTT Client library, and JSON library to interact with the [AWS IoT Device
Defender service](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-device-defender/).

The demo reports the following metrics to the AWS IoT Device Defender Service:
- Network statistics [Packets (Ethernet Frames) and Bytes sent and received over wire]
- List of open TCP ports
- List of open UDP ports
- List of established connections
- System CPU usage statistics (as a custom metric of number-list type)
- System memory statistics (as a custom metric of string-list type)

The demo gets the above metrics by reading `/proc/net/dev`, `/proc/net/tcp`,
`/proc/net/udp`, `/proc/uptime`, and `/proc/meminfo`. It then constructs a JSON report in the format as expected by
the AWS IoT Device Defender service. The constructed JSON report is then
published on the device defender MQTT topic reserved for publishing JSON
reports. The demo then waits for a report accepted response, and ensures that
the response contains the same report Id as was sent in the request.

For the AWS IoT Device Defender service to make use of the custom metrics reported by the demo, you need to
define the custom metrics in your account. You can use either the AWS console or CLI to create
custom metrics in your account. For more information, please refer to [Custom Metrics AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/dd-detect-custom-metrics.html).
