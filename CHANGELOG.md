## 202012.01 (December 2020)

### Major Changes

- This release introduces the **AWS IoT Over-the-air Update** library(Release Candidate), **backoffAlgorithm** library, and **PKCS #11** library.
These libraries have gone through code quality checks including verification that no function has a [GNU Complexity](https://www.gnu.org/software/complexity/manual/complexity.html) score greater than 8, checks against deviations from the mandatory rules in the [MISRA coding standard](https://www.misra.org.uk/MISRAHome/MISRAC2012/tabid/196/Default.aspx), and static code analysis from [Coverity statical analysis](https://scan.coverity.com/). In addition, PKCS11 library has also undergone validation of memory safety through the [CBMC automated reasoning tool](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/cbmc/).

- This release uses submodule references to the following new individual repositories for the AWS IoT Over-the-air Update, backoffAlgorithm, and PKCS11 libraries under the `libraries` folder:
   - [aws/ota-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk](https://github.com/aws/ota-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) for the AWS IoT Over-the-air Update library.
   - [FreeRTOS/backoffAlgorithm](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/backoffAlgorithm) for the backoffAlgorithm library.
   - [FreeRTOS/corePKCS11](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/corePKCS11) for the PKCS11 library.

## 202011.00 (November 2020)

### Major Changes

- This release introduces the re-factored **HTTP** client library, **AWS IoT Device Defender** client library, and **AWS IoT Jobs** client library.
These libraries have gone through code quality checks including verification that no function has a [GNU Complexity](https://www.gnu.org/software/complexity/manual/complexity.html) score greater than 8, and checks against deviations from the mandatory rules in the [MISRA coding standard](https://www.misra.org.uk/MISRAHome/MISRAC2012/tabid/196/Default.aspx). These libraries have also undergone both static code analysis from [Coverity statical analysis](https://scan.coverity.com/) and validation of memory safety through the [CBMC automated reasoning tool](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/cbmc/).

- This release uses submodule references to the following new individual repositories for the HTTP, AWS IoT Device Defender client, and AWS IoT Jobs client libraries under the `libraries` folder:
   - [FreeRTOS/coreHTTP](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreHTTP) for the HTTP client library
   - [aws/device-defender-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk](https://github.com/aws/device-defender-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) for the AWS IoT Device Defender client library.
   - [aws/jobs-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk](https://github.com/aws/jobs-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) for the AWS IoT Jobs client library.

## 202009.00 (September 2020)

### Major Changes

- This release introduces the re-factored **MQTT** client library, **JSON** parser library, and **AWS IoT Device Shadow** client library.
These libraries have gone through code quality checks including verification that no function has a [GNU Complexity](https://www.gnu.org/software/complexity/manual/complexity.html) score greater than 8, and checks against deviations from the mandatory rules in the [MISRA coding standard](https://www.misra.org.uk/MISRAHome/MISRAC2012/tabid/196/Default.aspx). These libraries have also undergone both static code analysis from [Coverity statical analysis](https://scan.coverity.com/) and validation of memory safety through the [CBMC automated reasoning tool](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/cbmc/).

- This release uses submodule references to the following new individual repositories for the MQTT, JSON, and AWS IoT Device Shadow client libraries under the `libraries` folder:
   - [FreeRTOS/coreMQTT](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT) for the MQTT client library
   - [FreeRTOS/coreJSON](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreJSON) for the JSON parser library
   - [aws/device-shadow-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk](https://github.com/aws/device-shadow-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) for the AWS IoT Device Shadow client library.
