/*
 * Demo for showing the use of MQTT APIs to establish an MQTT session,
 * subscribe to a topic, publish to a topic, receive incoming publishes,
 * unsubscribe from a topic and disconnect the MQTT session.
 *
 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory;
 * it uses QOS1 and therefore implements a retransmission mechanism
 * for Publish messages. Retransmission of publish messages are attempted
 * when a MQTT connection is established with a session that was already
 * present. All the outgoing publish messages waiting to receive PUBACK
 * are resend in this demo. In order to support retransmission all the outgoing
 * publishes are stored until a PUBACK is received.
