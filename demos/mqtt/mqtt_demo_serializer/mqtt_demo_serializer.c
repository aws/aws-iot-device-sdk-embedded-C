/**
 * @brief Demo that shows use of the MQTT serializer / deserializer API
 * to build an ultra-light weight MQTT client. This shows that a lighter weight
 * MQTT client can be developed without using the higher-level
 * MQTT API of core_mqtt.h, but just the serializer / deserializer API.
 * The core_mqtt_serializer.h API lets user to serialize and
 * deserialize MQTT messages into a user provided buffer.
 * This API allows use of a statically allocated buffer.
 *
 * The example shown below uses this API to create MQTT messages and
 * send them over the connection established using POSIX sockets.
 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory;
 * it uses QOS0 and therefore does not implement any retransmission
 * mechanism for Publish messages.
