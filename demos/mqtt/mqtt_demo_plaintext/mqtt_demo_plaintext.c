 * Demo for showing the use of MQTT APIs to establish an MQTT session,

 * The example shown below uses MQTT APIs to send and receive MQTT packets
 * over the TCP connection established using POSIX sockets.
 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory;
 * it uses QOS0 and therefore does not implement any retransmission
