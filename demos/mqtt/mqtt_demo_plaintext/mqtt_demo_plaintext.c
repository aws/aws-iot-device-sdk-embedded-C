 * Demo for showing the use of MQTT APIs to establish an MQTT session,

 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory;
 * it uses QOS0 and therefore does not implement any retransmission

/**
 * @brief Entry point of demo.
 *
 * The example shown below uses MQTT APIs to send and receive MQTT packets
 * over the TCP connection established using POSIX sockets.
 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory;
 * it uses QOS0 and therefore does not implement any retransmission
 * mechanism for Publish messages. This example runs forever, if connection to
 * the broker goes down, the code tries to reconnect to the broker with exponential
 * backoff mechanism.
