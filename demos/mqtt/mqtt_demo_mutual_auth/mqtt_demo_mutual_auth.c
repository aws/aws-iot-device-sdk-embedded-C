/*
 * Demo for showing the use of MQTT APIs to establish an MQTT session,
 * subscribe to a topic, publish to a topic, receive incoming publishes,
 * unsubscribe from a topic and disconnect the MQTT session.
 *
 * A mutually authenticated TLS connection is used to connect to the AWS IoT
 * MQTT message broker in this example. Define ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH for server
 * authentication in the client. Client authentication can be achieved in either
 * of the 2 different ways mentioned below.
 * 1. Define CLIENT_CERT_PATH and CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH in demo_config.h
 *    for client authentication to be done based on the client certificate
 *    and client private key. More details about this client authentication
 *    can be found in the link below.
 *    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/client-authentication.html
 * 2. Define CLIENT_USERNAME and CLIENT_PASSWORD in demo_config.h for client
 *    authentication to be done using a username and password. More details about
 *    this client authentication can be found in the link below.
 *    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/custom-authentication.html
 *    An authorizer setup needs to be done, as mentioned in the above link, to use
 *    username/password based client authentication.
 *
 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory;
 * it uses QOS1 and therefore implements a retransmission mechanism
 * for Publish messages. Retransmission of publish messages are attempted
 * when a MQTT connection is established with a session that was already
 * present. All the outgoing publish messages waiting to receive PUBACK
 * are resent in this demo. In order to support retransmission all the outgoing
 * publishes are stored until a PUBACK is received.
