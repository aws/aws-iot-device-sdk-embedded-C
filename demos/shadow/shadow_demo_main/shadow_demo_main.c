/**
 * @file shadow_demo_main.c
 *
 * @brief Demo for showing how to use the Device Shadow library's API. This version
 * of Device Shadow API provide macros and helper functions for assembling MQTT topics
 * strings, and for determining whether an incoming MQTT message is related to a
 * device shadow. The shadow can be either the classic shadow or a named shadow. Change
 * #SHADOW_NAME to select the shadow. The Device Shadow library does not depend on a MQTT library,
 * therefore the code for MQTT connections are placed in another file (shadow_demo_helpers.c)
 * to make it easy to read the code using Device Shadow library.
 *
 * This example assumes there is a powerOn state in the device shadow. It does the
 * following operations:
 * 1. Establish a MQTT connection by using the helper functions in shadow_demo_helpers.c.
 * 2. Assemble strings for the MQTT topics of device shadow, by using macros defined by the Device Shadow library.
 * 3. Subscribe to those MQTT topics by using helper functions in shadow_demo_helpers.c.
 * 4. Publish a desired state of powerOn by using helper functions in shadow_demo_helpers.c.  That will cause
 * a delta message to be sent to device.
 * 5. Handle incoming MQTT messages in eventCallback, determine whether the message is related to the device
 * shadow by using a function defined by the Device Shadow library (Shadow_MatchTopicString). If the message is a
 * device shadow delta message, set a flag for the main function to know, then the main function will publish
 * a second message to update the reported state of powerOn.
 * 6. Handle incoming message again in eventCallback. If the message is from update/accepted, verify that it
 * has the same clientToken as previously published in the update message. That will mark the end of the demo.

/**
 * @brief Entry point of shadow demo.
 *
 * This main function demonstrates how to use the macros provided by the
 * Device Shadow library to assemble strings for the MQTT topics defined
 * by AWS IoT Device Shadow. Named shadow topic strings differ from unnamed
 * ("Classic") topic strings as indicated by the tokens within square brackets.
 *
 * The main function uses these macros for topics to subscribe to:
 * - SHADOW_TOPIC_STR_UPDATE_DELTA for "$aws/things/thingName/shadow[/name/shadowname]/update/delta"
 * - SHADOW_TOPIC_STR_UPDATE_ACC for "$aws/things/thingName/shadow[/name/shadowname]/update/accepted"
 * - SHADOW_TOPIC_STR_UPDATE_REJ for "$aws/things/thingName/shadow[/name/shadowname]/update/rejected"
 *
 * It also uses these macros for topics to publish to:
 * - SHADOW_TOPIC_STR_DELETE for "$aws/things/thingName/shadow[/name/shadowname]/delete"
 * - SHADOW_TOPIC_STR_UPDATE for "$aws/things/thingName/shadow[/name/shadowname]/update"
 *
 * The helper functions this demo uses for MQTT operations have internal
 * loops to process incoming messages. Those are not the focus of this demo
 * and therefore, are placed in a separate file shadow_demo_helpers.c.
