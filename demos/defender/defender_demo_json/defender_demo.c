/*
 * Demo for showing how to use the Device Defender library's APIs. The Device
 * Defender library provides macros and helper functions for assembling MQTT
 * topics strings, and for determining whether an incoming MQTT message is
 * related to device defender. The Device Defender library does not depend on
 * any particular MQTT library, therefore the code for MQTT operations is
 * placed in another file (mqtt_operations.c). This demo uses the coreMQTT
 * library. If needed, mqtt_operations.c can be modified to replace coreMQTT
 * with another MQTT library. This demo requires using the AWS IoT broker as
 * Device Defender is an AWS service.
 *
 * This demo connects to the AWS IoT broker and subscribes to the device
 * defender topics. It then collects metrics for the open ports and sockets on
 * the device using FreeRTOS+TCP, and generates a device defender report. The
 * report is then published, and the demo waits for a response from the device
 * defender service. Upon receiving the response or timing out, the demo
 * finishes.
