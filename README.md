# AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C


**[API documentation of 202009.00 release](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/embedded-csdk/202009.00/lib-ref/index.html)**

We have released version 202009.00 of the AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded-C (C-SDK). This release includes refactored MQTT, JSON Parser, and AWS IoT Device Shadow libraries for optimized memory usage and modularity. These libraries are included in the SDK via [Git submoduling](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). These libraries have gone through code quality checks including verification that no function has a [GNU Complexity](https://www.gnu.org/software/complexity/manual/complexity.html) score over 8, and checks against deviations from mandatory rules in the [MISRA coding standard](https://www.misra.org.uk/MISRAHome/MISRAC2012/tabid/196/Default.aspx). Deviations from the MISRA C:2012 guidelines are documented under [MISRA Deviations](MISRA.md). These libraries have also undergone both static code analysis from [Coverity static analysis](https://scan.coverity.com/), and validation of memory safety and data structure invariance through the [CBMC automated reasoning tool](https://www.cprover.org/cbmc/).

If you are upgrading from v3.x API of the C-SDK to the 202009.00 release, please follow the [migration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/embedded-csdk/202009.00/lib-ref/docs/doxygen/output/html/migration_guide.html).
If you are using the C-SDK v4_beta_deprecated branch, note that we will continue to maintain this branch for critical bug fixes and security patches but will not add new features to it. See the C-SDK v4_beta_deprecated branch [README](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/blob/v4_beta_deprecated/README.md) for additional details.

## Overview

The AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C (C-SDK) is a collection of C source files under the [MIT open source license](LICENSE) that can be used in embedded applications to securely connect IoT devices to [AWS IoT Core](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html). It contains an MQTT client, HTTP client, JSON Parser, and AWS IoT Device Shadow client libraries. It is distributed in source form, and is intended to be built into customer firmware along with application code, other libraries and optionally, an RTOS (Real-Time Operating System).

## Features

The C-SDK simplifies access to AWS IoT Services. The SDK has been tested to work with AWS IoT Core and an open source MQTT broker to ensure high quality interoperability.
The AWS IoT Device Shadow library is flexible to work with any MQTT client and JSON parser. The MQTT client and JSON parser libraries in the C-SDK are offered as choices without being tightly coupled with the rest of the SDK.
The C-SDK contains the following libraries:

### MQTT
The C-SDK provides the ability to establish an MQTT connection with a broker over a customer-implemented transport layer, which can either be a secure channel like a TLS session (mutually authenticated or server-only authentication) or a non-secure channel like a plaintext TCP connection. This MQTT connection can be used for performing publish operations to MQTT topics and subscribing to MQTT topics. The SDK provides a mechanism to register customer-defined callbacks for receiving incoming PUBLISH, acknowledgement and keep-alive response events from the broker.  The [coreMQTT](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT) library has been refactored for memory optimization and is fully compliant with the [MQTT 3.1.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html) standard.  It has no dependencies on any additional libraries other than the standard C library, a customer-implemented network transport interface, and *optionally* a customer-implemented platform time function.  The refactored design embraces different use-cases, ranging from resource-constrained platforms using only QoS 0 MQTT PUBLISH messages to resource-rich platforms using QoS 2 MQTT PUBLISH over TLS connections.

### HTTP
The C-SDK provides the ability to establish an HTTP connection with a server over a customer-implemented transport layer, which can either be a secure channel like a TLS session (mutually authenticated or server-only authentication) or a non-secure channel like a plaintext TCP connection. The HTTP connection can be used to make "GET" (include range requests), "PUT", "POST" and "HEAD" requests. The SDK provides a mechanism to register a customer-defined callback for receiving parsed header fields in an HTTP response. The [coreHTTP](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreHTTP) library has been refactored for memory optimization, and is a client implementation of a subset of the [HTTP/1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) standard.

### AWS IoT Device Shadow
[AWS IoT Device Shadow](https://github.com/aws/device-shadow-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) enables you to store and retrieve the current state (the “shadow”) of every registered device. The device’s shadow is a persistent, virtual representation of your device that you can interact with from AWS IoT Core even if the device is offline. The device state captured as its “shadow” is itself a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) document. The device can send commands over MQTT or HTTP to update its latest state. Each device’s shadow is uniquely identified by the name of the corresponding “thing”, a representation of a specific device or logical entity on the AWS Cloud. See [Managing Devices with AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-thing-management.html) for more information. More details about shadows can be found in [AWS IoT documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html).

### JSON Parser
The [coreJSON](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreJSON) library is a JSON parser that strictly enforces the [ECMA-404 JSON standard](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). It provides a function to validate a JSON document, and a function to search for a key and return its value. A search can descend into nested structures using a compound query key. A JSON document validation also checks for illegal UTF8 encodings and illegal Unicode escape sequences.


## AWS Collection of Metrics

AWS collects usage metrics indicating the operating system, hardware platform and MQTT client information of use to AWS IoT from the MQTT mutual auth demo by sending a specially formatted string in the username field of the MQTT CONNECT packet. These metrics help AWS IoT improve security and provide better technical support. Providing these metrics is optional for users, and can be disabled by updating the `OS_NAME`, `OS_VERSION`, `HARDWARE_PLATFORM_NAME` and `MQTT_LIB` configuration macros in the `demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_mutual_auth/demo_config.h` file of the MQTT mutual auth demo.

### Format

The format of the username string with metrics is:
```
<Actual_Username>?SDK=<OS_Name>&Version=<OS_Version>&Platform=<Hardware_Platform>&MQTTLib=<MQTT_Library_name>@<MQTT_Library_version>
```
where

* **Actual_Username** is the actual username used for authentication (if a username/password is used for authentication).
* **OS_Name** is the Operating System the application is running on.
* **OS_Version** is the version number of the Operating System.
* **Hardware_Platform** is the Hardware Platform the application is running on.
* **MQTT_Library_name** is the MQTT Client library being used.
* **MQTT_Library_version** is the version of the MQTT Client library being used.

## Branches

### master branch
The [master](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/master) branch hosts the continuous development of the AWS IoT Embedded C SDK (C-SDK) libraries. Please be aware that the development at the tip of the master branch is continuously in progress, and may have bugs. Consider using the [tagged releases](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/releases) of the C-SDK for production ready software.

### v4_beta_deprecated branch (Formerly named v4_beta)
The [v4_beta_deprecated](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/v4_beta_deprecated) branch contains a beta version of the C-SDK libraries, which is now deprecated. This branch was earlier named as *v4_beta*, and was renamed to *v4_beta_deprecated*. The libraries in this branch will not be released. However, critical bugs will be fixed and tested. No new features will be added to this branch.


## Releases

All of the released versions of the C-SDK libraries are available as git tags. For example, the last release of the v3 SDK version is available at [tag 3.0.1](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/v3.0.1).

## Versioning

C-SDK releases will now follow a date based versioning scheme with the format YYYYMM.NN_major, where:

* Y represents the year.
* M represents the month.
* N represents the release order within the designated month (00 being the first release).
* A "major" denotation indicates the addition of new features or significant updates to multiple libraries.

For example, a second release in June 2021 would be 202106.01. Although the SDK releases have moved to date-based versioning, each library within the SDK will still retain semantic versioning. In semantic versioning, the version number itself (X.Y.Z) indicates whether the release is a major, minor, or point release. You can use the semantic version of a library to assess the scope and impact of a new release on your application.

## Building and Running Demos


The libraries in this SDK are not dependent on any operating system. However, the demos for the libraries in this SDK are built and tested on a Linux platform. The demos builds with [CMake](https://cmake.org/), a cross-platform build tool.


### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.13.0 or later for utilizing the build system of the repository.

- C90 compiler

- Although not a part of the ISO C90 standard, `stdint.h` is required for fixed-width integer types that include `uint8_t`, `int8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `int32_t`, and constant macros like `UINT16_MAX`.

- A supported operating system. The ports provided with this repo are expected to work with all recent versions of the following operating systems, although we cannot guarantee the behavior on all systems.
    - Linux system with POSIX sockets and timer APIs. (We have tested on Ubuntu 18.04).
        - On Linux systems, installation of OpenSSL development libraries and header files, *version 1.1.0 or later*, are required. The OpenSSL development libraries are usually called something like `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel` when installed through a package manager.


### AWS IoT Account Setup

You need to setup an AWS account and access the AWS IoT console for running the AWS IoT Device Shadow library demo and tests.
Also, the AWS account can be used for running the MQTT mutual auth demo can be run against AWS IoT broker.

Follow the links to:

-  [Setup an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start).

-  [Sign-in to the AWS IoT Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) after setting up the AWS account.


### Configuring the mutual auth demos

- You can pass the following configuration settings as command line options in order to run the mutual auth demos:
```bash
cmake .. -DAWS_IOT_ENDPOINT="aws-iot-endpoint" -DROOT_CA_CERT_PATH="root-ca-path" -DCLIENT_CERT_PATH="certificate-path" -DCLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="private-key-path"
```

- In order to set these configurations manually, edit `demo_config.h` in `demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_mutual_auth/` and `demos/http/http_demo_mutual_auth/` to `#define` the following:

	- Set `AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT` to your custom endpoint. This is found on the *Settings* page of the AWS IoT Console and has a format of `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`.

	- Set `ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` to the path of the root CA certificate downloaded when setting up the device certificate in [AWS IoT Account Setup](#aws-iot-account-setup).

	- Set `CLIENT_CERT_PATH` to the path of the client certificate downloaded when setting up the device certificate in [AWS IoT Account Setup](#aws-iot-account-setup).

	- Set `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` to the path of the private key downloaded when setting up the device certificate in [AWS IoT Account Setup](#aws-iot-account-setup).


### Build Steps

1. Go to the root directory of this repository.

1. Create build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`

1. Run *cmake* while inside build directory: `cmake ..`

1. Run this command to build the demos: `make`

1. Go to the `build/bin` directory and run any demo executables from there.

### Alternative option of Docker containers for running demos locally.

Install Docker:

```shell

curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

sh get-docker.sh

```

#### Installing Mosquitto to run MQTT demos locally

The following instructions have been tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 environment with Docker and OpenSSL installed.

1.  Download the official Docker image for Mosquitto.

```shell

docker pull eclipse-mosquitto:latest

```
2.  `BROKER_ENDPOINT` defined in `demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_basic_tls/demo_config.h` can now be set to `localhost`.

3. For TLS communication with Mosquitto broker, server and CA credentials need to be created. Use OpenSSL commands to generate the credentials for the Mosquitto server.
**Note:** Make sure to use different Common Name (CN) detail between the CA and server certificates; otherwise, SSL handshake fails with exactly same Common Name (CN) detail in both the certificates.
```shell
# Generate CA key and certificate. Provide the Subject field information as appropriate for CA certificate.
openssl req -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt
```

```shell
# Generate server key and certificate.
# Provide the Subject field information as appropriate for Server certificate. Make sure the Common Name (CN) field is different from the root CA certificate.
openssl req -nodes -sha256 -new -keyout server.key -out server.csr
# Sign with the CA cert.
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365

```

4. Create a mosquitto.conf file to use port 8883 (for TLS communication) and providing path to the generated credentials.

```
port 8883

cafile /mosquitto/config/ca.crt
certfile /mosquitto/config/server.crt
keyfile /mosquitto/config/server.key

# Use this option for TLS mutual authentication (where client will provide CA signed certificate)
#require_certificate true
tls_version tlsv1.2
#use_identity_as_username true

```

5. Run the docker container from the local directory containing the generated credential and mosquitto.conf files.

```shell
docker run -it -p 8883:8883 -v $(pwd):/mosquitto/config/ --name mosquitto-basic-tls eclipse-mosquitto:latest
```

6. Set `ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` to the absolute path of the CA certificate created in step 3. for the local Mosquitto server.

#### Installing httpbin to run HTTP demos locally

1. Run httpbin through port 80:

```shell
docker pull kennethreitz/httpbin
docker run -p 80:80 kennethreitz/httpbin
```

2.  `SERVER_HOST` defined in `demos/http/http_demo_plaintext/demo_config.h` can now be set to `localhost`.

3. To run `http_demo_basic_tls`, [download ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) in order to create an HTTPS tunnel to the httpbin server currently hosted on port 80:

```shell
./ngrok http 80 # May have to use ./ngrok.exe depending on OS or filename of the executable
```

4.  `ngrok` will provide an https link that can be substituted in `demos/http/http_demo_basic_tls/demo_config.h` and has a format of `https://ABCDEFG12345.ngrok.io`.

5. Set `SERVER_HOST` in `demos/http/http_demo_basic_tls/demo_config.h` to the https link provided by ngrok.

6. You must also download the Root CA certificate provided by ngrok and set `ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` in `demo_config.h` to the file path of the downloaded certificate.
