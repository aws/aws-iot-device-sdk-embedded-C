## Overview

The AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C (C-SDK) is a collection of C source files under the [MIT open source license](LICENSE) that can be used in embedded applications to securely connect IoT devices to [AWS IoT Core](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html). It contains MQTT client, HTTP client, JSON Parser, AWS IoT Device Shadow, AWS IoT Jobs, and AWS IoT Device Defender libraries. This SDK is distributed in source form, and can be built into customer firmware along with application code, other libraries and an operating system (OS) of your choice. These libraries are only dependent on standard C libraries, so they can be ported to various OS's - from embedded Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) to Linux/Mac/Windows. You can find sample usage of C-SDK libraries on POSIX systems using OpenSSL (e.g. [Linux demos](demos) in this repository), and on [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/) using mbedTLS (e.g. [FreeRTOS demos](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/tree/master/FreeRTOS-Plus/Demo) in [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/) repository).

For the latest release of C-SDK, please see the section for [Releases](#releases).

### License

The C-SDK libraries are licensed under the [MIT open source license](LICENSE).

### Features

C-SDK simplifies access to various AWS IoT services. C-SDK has been tested to work with [AWS IoT Core](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html) and an open source MQTT broker to ensure interoperability. The AWS IoT Device Shadow, AWS IoT Jobs, and AWS IoT Device Defender libraries are flexible to work with any MQTT client and JSON parser. The MQTT client and JSON parser libraries are offered as choices without being tightly coupled with the rest of the SDK. C-SDK contains the following libraries:

#### coreMQTT

The [coreMQTT](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT) library provides the ability to establish an MQTT connection with a broker over a customer-implemented transport layer, which can either be a secure channel like a TLS session (mutually authenticated or server-only authentication) or a non-secure channel like a plaintext TCP connection. This MQTT connection can be used for performing publish operations to MQTT topics and subscribing to MQTT topics. The library provides a mechanism to register customer-defined callbacks for receiving incoming PUBLISH, acknowledgement and keep-alive response events from the broker. The library has been refactored for memory optimization and is compliant with the [MQTT 3.1.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html) standard. It has no dependencies on any additional libraries other than the standard C library, a customer-implemented network transport interface, and optionally a customer-implemented platform time function. The refactored design embraces different use-cases, ranging from resource-constrained platforms using only QoS 0 MQTT PUBLISH messages to resource-rich platforms using QoS 2 MQTT PUBLISH over TLS connections.

See memory requirements for the latest release [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/standard/coreMQTT/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#mqtt_memory_requirements).

#### coreHTTP

The [coreHTTP](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreHTTP) library provides the ability to establish an HTTP connection with a server over a customer-implemented transport layer, which can either be a secure channel like a TLS session (mutually authenticated or server-only authentication) or a non-secure channel like a plaintext TCP connection. The HTTP connection can be used to make "GET" (include range requests), "PUT", "POST" and "HEAD" requests. The library provides a mechanism to register a customer-defined callback for receiving parsed header fields in an HTTP response. The library has been refactored for memory optimization, and is a client implementation of a subset of the [HTTP/1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) standard.

See memory requirements for the latest release [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/standard/coreHTTP/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#http_memory_requirements).

#### coreJSON

The [coreJSON](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreJSON) library is a JSON parser that strictly enforces the [ECMA-404 JSON standard](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). It provides a function to validate a JSON document, and a function to search for a key and return its value. A search can descend into nested structures using a compound query key. A JSON document validation also checks for illegal UTF8 encodings and illegal Unicode escape sequences.

See memory requirements for the latest release [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/standard/coreJSON/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#json_memory_requirements).

#### AWS IoT Device Shadow

The [AWS IoT Device Shadow](https://github.com/aws/device-shadow-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) library enables you to store and retrieve the current state (the “shadow”) of every registered device. The device’s shadow is a persistent, virtual representation of your device that you can interact with from AWS IoT Core even if the device is offline. The device state captured as its “shadow” is itself a JSON document. The device can send commands over MQTT or HTTP to update its latest state. Each device’s shadow is uniquely identified by the name of the corresponding “thing”, a representation of a specific device or logical entity on AWS IoT. More details about AWS IoT Device Shadow can be found in [AWS IoT documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html).

The AWS IoT Device Shadow library has no dependencies on additional libraries other than the standard C library. It also doesn’t have any platform dependencies, such as threading or synchronization. It can be used with any MQTT library and any JSON library (see [demos](demos/shadow) with coreMQTT and coreJSON).

See memory requirements for the latest release [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/aws/device-shadow-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#shadow_memory_requirements).


#### AWS IoT Jobs

The [AWS IoT Jobs](https://github.com/aws/jobs-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) library enables you to interact with the AWS IoT Jobs service which notifies one or more connected devices of a pending “Job”. A Job can be used to manage your fleet of devices, update firmware and security certificates on your devices, or perform administrative tasks such as restarting devices and performing diagnostics. For documentation of the service, please see the [AWS IoT Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html). Interactions with the Jobs service use the MQTT protocol. This library provides an API to compose and recognize the MQTT topic strings used by the Jobs service.

The AWS IoT Jobs library has no dependencies on additional libraries other than the standard C library. It also doesn’t have any platform dependencies, such as threading or synchronization. It can be used with any MQTT library and any JSON library (see [demos](demos/jobs) with [libmosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) and coreJSON).

See memory requirements for the latest release [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/aws/jobs-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#jobs_memory_requirements).


#### AWS IoT Device Defender


The [AWS IoT Device Defender](https://github.com/aws/device-defender-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk) library enables you to interact with the AWS IoT Device Defender service to continuously monitor security metrics from devices for deviations from what you have defined as appropriate behavior for each device. If something doesn’t look right, AWS IoT Device Defender sends out an alert so you can take action to remediate the issue. More details about Device Defender can be found in [AWS IoT Device Defender documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-defender.html).

The AWS IoT Device Defender library has no dependencies on additional libraries other than the standard C library. It also doesn’t have any platform dependencies, such as threading or synchronization. It can be used with any MQTT library and any JSON library (see [demos](demos/defender) with coreMQTT and coreJSON).

See memory requirements for the latest release [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/libraries/aws/device-defender-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk/docs/doxygen/output/html/index.html#defender_memory_requirements).

#### backoffAlgorithm 

The [backoffAlgorithm](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/backoffAlgorithm) library is a utility library to calculate backoff period using an exponential backoff with jitter algorithm for retrying network operations (like failed network connection with server). This library uses the "Full Jitter" strategy for the exponential backoff with jitter algorithm. More information about the algorithm can be seen in the Exponential Backoff and Jitter (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/) AWS blog.

Exponential backoff with jitter is typically used when retrying a failed connection or network request to the server. An exponential backoff with jitter helps to mitigate the failed network operations with servers, that are caused due to network congestion or high load on the server, by spreading out retry requests across multiple devices attempting network operations. Besides, in an environment with poor connectivity, a client can get disconnected at any time. A backoff strategy helps the client to conserve battery by not repeatedly attempting reconnections when they are unlikely to succeed.

The backoffAlgorithm library has no dependencies on libraries other than the standard C library.

See memory requirements for the latest release [here](ADD_LINK_HERE).

### AWS Collection of Metrics

AWS collects usage metrics indicating the operating system, hardware platform and MQTT client information of use to AWS IoT from the MQTT mutual auth demo by sending a specially formatted string in the username field of the MQTT CONNECT packet. These metrics help AWS IoT improve security and provide better technical support. Providing these metrics is optional for users, and can be disabled by updating the `OS_NAME`, `OS_VERSION`, `HARDWARE_PLATFORM_NAME` and `MQTT_LIB` configuration macros in the `demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_mutual_auth/demo_config.h` file of the MQTT mutual auth demo.

### Format

The format of the username string with metrics is:

```
<Actual_Username>?SDK=<OS_Name>&Version=<OS_Version>&Platform=<Hardware_Platform>&MQTTLib=<MQTT_Library_name>@<MQTT_Library_version>
```

where

* **Actual_Username** is the actual username used for authentication (if a username/password is used for authentication).
* **OS_Name** is the Operating System the application is running on.
* **OS_Version** is the version number of the Operating System.
* **Hardware_Platform** is the Hardware Platform the application is running on.
* **MQTT_Library_name** is the MQTT Client library being used.
* **MQTT_Library_version** is the version of the MQTT Client library being used.

## Versioning

C-SDK releases will now follow a date based versioning scheme with the format YYYYMM.NN, where:

* Y represents the year.
* M represents the month.
* N represents the release order within the designated month (00 being the first release).

For example, a second release in June 2021 would be 202106.01. Although the SDK releases have moved to date-based versioning, each library within the SDK will still retain semantic versioning. In semantic versioning, the version number itself (X.Y.Z) indicates whether the release is a major, minor, or point release. You can use the semantic version of a library to assess the scope and impact of a new release on your application.

## Releases

All of the released versions of the C-SDK libraries are available as git tags. For example, the last release of the v3 SDK version is available at [tag 3.1.2](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/v3.1.2).

### 202011.00

[API documentation of 202011.00 release](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202011.00/lib-ref/index.html)

This release includes refactored HTTP client, AWS IoT Device Defender, and AWS IoT Jobs libraries. Additionally, there is a major update to the coreJSON API. All libraries continue to undergo code quality checks (e.g. MISRA-C compliance), Coverity static analysis, and validation of memory safety with the C Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) automated reasoning tool.

### 202009.00

[API documentation of 202009.00 release](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/embedded-csdk/202009.00/lib-ref/index.html)

This release includes refactored MQTT, JSON Parser, and AWS IoT Device Shadow libraries for optimized memory usage and modularity. These libraries are included in the SDK via [Git submoduling](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). These libraries have gone through code quality checks including verification that no function has a [GNU Complexity](https://www.gnu.org/software/complexity/manual/complexity.html) score over 8, and checks against deviations from mandatory rules in the [MISRA coding standard](https://www.misra.org.uk/MISRAHome/MISRAC2012/tabid/196/Default.aspx). Deviations from the MISRA C:2012 guidelines are documented under [MISRA Deviations](MISRA.md). These libraries have also undergone both static code analysis from [Coverity static analysis](https://scan.coverity.com/), and validation of memory safety and data structure invariance through the [CBMC automated reasoning tool](https://www.cprover.org/cbmc/).

If you are upgrading from v3.x API of the C-SDK to the 202009.00 release, please refer to [Migration guide from v3.1.2 to 202009.00 and newer releases](#migration-guide-from-v312-to-20200900-and-newer-releases). If you are using the C-SDK v4_beta_deprecated branch, note that we will continue to maintain this branch for critical bug fixes and security patches but will not add new features to it. See the C-SDK v4_beta_deprecated branch [README](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/blob/v4_beta_deprecated/README.md) for additional details.

### v3.1.2

Details available [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/v3.1.2).

## Porting Guide for 202009.00 and newer releases

All libraries depend on the ISO C90 standard library and additionally on the `stdint.h` library for fixed-width integers, including `uint8_t`, `int8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `int32_t`, and constant macros like `UINT16_MAX`. If your platform does not support the `stdint.h` library, definitions of the mentioned fixed-width integer types will be required for porting any C-SDK library to your platform.

The [main](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/main) branch hosts the continuous development of the AWS IoT Embedded C SDK (C-SDK) libraries. Please be aware that the development at the tip of the main branch is continuously in progress, and may have bugs. Consider using the [tagged releases](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/releases) of the C-SDK for production ready software.

### v4_beta_deprecated branch (formerly named v4_beta)

The [v4_beta_deprecated](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/v4_beta_deprecated) branch contains a beta version of the C-SDK libraries, which is now deprecated. This branch was earlier named as v4_beta, and was renamed to v4_beta_deprecated. The libraries in this branch will not be released. However, critical bugs will be fixed and tested. No new features will be added to this branch.

## Getting Started

### Cloning

This repository uses [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to bring in the C-SDK libraries (eg, MQTT ) and third-party dependencies (eg, mbedtls for POSIX platform transport layer).
Note: If you download the ZIP file provided by GitHub UI, you will not get the contents of the submodules (The ZIP file is also not a valid git repository). If you download from the [202011.00 Release Page](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/releases/tag/202011.00) page, you will get the entire repository (including the submodules) in the ZIP file, aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-c-202011.00.zip.
To clone using HTTPS:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C.git
```

Using SSH:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C.git
```

If you have downloaded the repo without using the `--recurse-submodules` argument, you need to run:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building and Running Demos

The libraries in this SDK are not dependent on any operating system. However, the demos for the libraries in this SDK are built and tested on a Linux platform. The demos builds with [CMake](https://cmake.org/), a cross-platform build tool.

#### Prerequisites

* CMake 3.2.0 or later for utilizing the build system of the repository.
* C90 compiler
* Although not a part of the ISO C90 standard, `stdint.h` is required for fixed-width integer types that include `uint8_t`, `int8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `int32_t`, and constant macros like `UINT16_MAX`.
* A supported operating system. The ports provided with this repo are expected to work with all recent versions of the following operating systems, although we cannot guarantee the behavior on all systems.
    * Linux system with POSIX sockets and timer APIs. (We have tested on Ubuntu 18.04).
        * On Linux systems, installation of OpenSSL development libraries and header files, *version 1.1.0 or later*, are required. The OpenSSL development libraries are usually called something like `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel` when installed through a package manager.

#### AWS IoT Account Setup

You need to setup an AWS account and access the AWS IoT console for running the AWS IoT Device Shadow library demo and tests. Also, the AWS account can be used for running the MQTT mutual auth demo can be run against AWS IoT broker.
Follow the links to:
[Setup an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start).
[Sign-in to the AWS IoT Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) after setting up the AWS account.

#### Configuring the mutual auth demos

You can pass the following configuration settings as command line options in order to run the mutual auth demos:

```sh
cmake .. -DAWS_IOT_ENDPOINT="aws-iot-endpoint" -DROOT_CA_CERT_PATH="root-ca-path" -DCLIENT_CERT_PATH="certificate-path" -DCLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="private-key-path"
```

In order to set these configurations manually, edit `demo_config.h` in `demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_mutual_auth/` and `demos/http/http_demo_mutual_auth/` to `#define` the following:

* Set `AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT` to your custom endpoint. This is found on the *Settings* page of the AWS IoT Console and has a format of `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`.
* Set `ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` to the path of the root CA certificate downloaded when setting up the device certificate in [AWS IoT Account Setup](#aws-iot-account-setup).
* Set `CLIENT_CERT_PATH` to the path of the client certificate downloaded when setting up the device certificate in [AWS IoT Account Setup](#aws-iot-account-setup).
* Set `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` to the path of the private key downloaded when setting up the device certificate in [AWS IoT Account Setup](#aws-iot-account-setup).

#### Configuring the S3 demos

You can pass the following configuration settings as command line options in order to run the S3 demos:

```sh
cmake .. -DS3_PRESIGNED_GET_URL="s3-get-url"  -DS3_PRESIGNED_PUT_URL="s3-put-url"
```

`S3_PRESIGNED_PUT_URL` is only needed for the S3 upload demo.

In order to set these configurations manually, edit `demo_config.h` in `demos/http/http_demo_s3_download`, `demos/http/http_demo_s3_download_multithreaded`, and `demos/http/http_demo_s3_upload` to `#define` the following:

* Set `S3_PRESIGNED_GET_URL` to a S3 presigned URL with GET access.
* Set `S3_PRESIGNED_PUT_URL` to a S3 presigned URL with PUT access.

You can generate the presigned urls using [demos/http/common/src/presigned_urls_gen.py](demos/http/common/src/presigned_urls_gen.py). More info can be found [here](demos/http/common/src/README.md).

#### Build Steps

* Go to the root directory of this repository.
* Create build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
* Run *cmake* while inside build directory: `cmake ..`
* Run this command to build the demos: `make`
* Go to the `build/bin` directory and run any demo executables from there.

#### Alternative option of Docker containers for running demos locally

Install Docker:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

sh get-docker.sh
```

##### Installing Mosquitto to run MQTT demos locally

The following instructions have been tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 environment with Docker and OpenSSL installed.

1. Download the official Docker image for Mosquitto.

    ```sh
    docker pull eclipse-mosquitto:latest
    ```

1. If a Mosquitto broker with TLS communication needs to be run, ignore this step and proceed to the next step. A Mosquitto broker with plain text communication can be run by executing the command below.

    ```
    docker run -it -p 1883:1883 --name mosquitto-plain-text eclipse-mosquitto:latest
    ```

1. Set `BROKER_ENDPOINT` defined in `demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_plaintext/demo_config.h` to `localhost`.

    Ignore the remaining steps unless a Mosquitto broker with TLS communication also needs to be run.

1. For TLS communication with Mosquitto broker, server and CA credentials need to be created. Use OpenSSL commands to generate the credentials for the Mosquitto server.

    Note: Make sure to use different Common Name (CN) detail between the CA and server certificates; otherwise, SSL handshake fails with exactly same Common Name (CN) detail in both the certificates.

    ```sh
    # Generate CA key and certificate. Provide the Subject field information as appropriate for CA certificate.
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt
    ```

    ```sh
    # Generate server key and certificate.# Provide the Subject field information as appropriate for Server certificate. Make sure the Common Name (CN) field is different from the root CA certificate.
    openssl req -nodes -sha256 -new -keyout server.key -out server.csr # Sign with the CA cert.
    openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
    ```

1. Create a mosquitto.conf file to use port 8883 (for TLS communication) and providing path to the generated credentials.

    ```
    port 8883

    cafile /mosquitto/config/ca.crt
    certfile /mosquitto/config/server.crt
    keyfile /mosquitto/config/server.key

    # Use this option for TLS mutual authentication (where client will provide CA signed certificate)
    #require_certificate true
    tls_version tlsv1.2
    #use_identity_as_username true
    ```

1. Run the docker container from the local directory containing the generated credential and mosquitto.conf files.

    ```sh
    docker run -it -p 8883:8883 -v $(pwd):/mosquitto/config/ --name mosquitto-basic-tls eclipse-mosquitto:latest
    ```

1. Update `demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_basic_tls/demo_config.h` to the following:  
   Set `BROKER_ENDPOINT` to `localhost`.  
   Set `ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` to the absolute path of the CA certificate created in step 4. for the local Mosquitto server.

##### Installing httpbin to run HTTP demos locally

Run httpbin through port 80:

```sh
docker pull kennethreitz/httpbin
docker run -p 80:80 kennethreitz/httpbin
```

`SERVER_HOST` defined in `demos/http/http_demo_plaintext/demo_config.h` can now be set to `localhost`.

To run `http_demo_basic_tls`, [download ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) in order to create an HTTPS tunnel to the httpbin server currently hosted on port 80:

```sh
./ngrok http 80 # May have to use ./ngrok.exe depending on OS or filename of the executable
```

`ngrok` will provide an https link that can be substituted in `demos/http/http_demo_basic_tls/demo_config.h` and has a format of `https://ABCDEFG12345.ngrok.io`.

Set `SERVER_HOST` in `demos/http/http_demo_basic_tls/demo_config.h` to the https link provided by ngrok, without `https://` preceding it.

You must also download the Root CA certificate provided by the ngrok https link and set `ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` in `demos/http/http_demo_basic_tls/demo_config.h` to the file path of the downloaded certificate.
