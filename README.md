[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/badge.svg?branch=v4_beta)](https://coveralls.io/github/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C?branch=v4_beta)

The AWS IoT Device SDK for C is a collection of C99 source files that allow applications to securely connect to the AWS IoT platform. It includes an MQTT 3.1.1 client, as well as libraries specific to AWS IoT, such as Thing Shadows. It is distributed in source form and may be built into firmware along with application code.

This library supersedes both the AWS IoT Device SDK Embedded C and the libraries provided with Amazon FreeRTOS.

## Features

This library is a new design that inherits from both the AWS IoT Device SDK Embedded C and the libraries provided with Amazon FreeRTOS. In addition, it provides the following new features:
- Asynchronous API for both MQTT and Thing Shadow.
- Multithreaded API by default (removed the `yield` function).
- More efficient platform layer (especially timers).
- Complete separation of MQTT and network stack, allowing MQTT to run over any network stack.
- Configurable memory allocation (static-only or dynamic). Memory allocation functions may also be set by the user.
- Network stack based on OpenSSL when building for Linux.
- MQTT persistent session support.
- Device Defender library.

Compared to the AWS IoT Device SDK Embedded C v3.0.1, the following features were removed:
- Auto-reconnect for MQTT connections.
- Shadow JSON document generator.

## Building and Running Demos

**Main documentation page:** [Building the SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/c-sdk/main/building.html)

This SDK builds with [CMake](https://cmake.org/), a cross-platform build tool. This repo contains a ready-to-use port for Linux.

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.5.0 or later and a C99 compiler.
- A supported operating system. The ports provided with this repo are expected to work with all recent versions of the following operating systems, although we cannot guarantee the behavior on all systems. For reference, the version used by this repo's Travis CI builds are listed in parentheses.
    - Linux system with POSIX thread and timer APIs. (CI tests on Ubuntu 16.04).<br>
    On Linux systems, the OpenSSL network implementation may be used instead of the default network implementation based on mbed TLS. This requires the installation of OpenSSL development libraries and header files, version 1.0.2g or later. The OpenSSL development libraries are usually called something like `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel` when installed through a package manager.

### Build Steps
1. Clone the source code and submodules. This SDK uses third-party libraries as submodules in the `third_party` directory.
    - If the source code is downloaded via `git clone`, nothing further needs to be done. The CMake build system can automatically clone submodules in this case.
    - For any other download, the submodules must be downloaded and placed in their respective `third_party` directory.
        - [mbed TLS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/tree/mbedtls-2.17) → `third_party/mbedtls/mbedtls`
        - [tinyCBOR](https://github.com/intel/tinycbor) → `third_party/tinycbor/tinycbor`
2. Complete the first 6 steps in the guide [Getting Started with AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html). The guide mentions the AWS IoT Button, but you do not need one to use this SDK.
    1. [Sign in to the AWS IoT Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-console-signin.html)
    2. [Register a Device in the Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-device.html)
    3. [Create and Activate a Device Certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device-certificate.html)
    4. [Create an AWS IoT Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-iot-policy.html)
    5. [Attach an AWS IoT Policy to a Device Certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/attach-policy-to-certificate.html)
    6. [Attach a Certificate to a Thing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/attach-cert-thing.html)
3. *Optional:* Set the following `#define` in [iot_config.h](demos/iot_config.h). You may skip this step and instead pass these configuration settings as command line options when running the demos.
    - Set `IOT_DEMO_IDENTIFIER` to the Thing Name you set in [step 1.2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-device.html). The corresponding command line option for this constant is `-i`.
    - Set `IOT_DEMO_SERVER` to your custom endpoint. This is found on the *Settings* page of the AWS IoT Console and has a format of `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`. The corresponding command line option for this constant is `-h`.
    - Set `IOT_DEMO_ROOT_CA` to the path of the root CA certificate downloaded in [step 1.3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device-certificate.html). The corresponding command line option for this constant is `-r`.
    - Set `IOT_DEMO_CLIENT_CERT` to the path of the client certificate downloaded in [step 1.3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device-certificate.html). The corresponding command line option for this constant is `-c`.
    - Set `IOT_DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY` to the path of the private downloaded in [step 1.3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device-certificate.html). The corresponding command line option for this constant is `-k`.
4. Make a build directory in the SDK's root directory and `cd` into it.
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
5. Run CMake from the build directory.
    ```sh
    cmake ..
    ```
    CMake will generate a project based on the detected operating system. On Linux, the default project is a Makefile. To build the SDK with this Makefile, run `make`.

    You may also use CMake GUI. Specify the SDK's root directory as the source directory and the build directory created in step 4 as the build directory in CMake GUI.

See the documentation page [Building the SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/c-sdk/main/building.html) for a list of options that can be used to configure the build system.

## Porting the SDK

Please refer to the [Porting Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/c-sdk/main/guide_developer_porting.html) for instructions on porting this SDK.

Existing ports (which may be used as examples) are present in `ports`. A blank template for implementing new ports is in `ports/template`.
