 * @brief Find a key in a JSON object and output a pointer to its value.
 *
 * @param[in] buf  The buffer to search.
 * @param[in] max  size of the buffer.
 * @param[in] queryKey  The key to search for.
 * @param[in] queryKeyLength  Length of the key.
 * @param[in] separator  A character between a key and a sub-key in queryKey.
 * @param[out] outValue  A pointer to receive the address of the value found.
 * @param[out] outValueLength  A pointer to receive the length of the value found.
 *
 * The JSON document must contain an object (e.g., '{"key":"value"}'). Any
 * value may also be an object and so forth to a maximum depth.  A search
 * may descend through nested objects when the queryKey contains matching
 * key strings joined by a separator.
 *
 * For example, if buf contains '{"foo":"abc","bar":{"foo":"xyz"}}', then a
 * search for 'foo' would output 'abc', 'bar' would output '{"foo":"xyz"}',
 * and a search for 'bar.foo' would output 'xyz' (given separator is
 * specified as '.').
 *
 * On success, the pointer to the value points to a location in buf.  No null
 * termination is done for the value.  For valid JSON it is safe to place
 * a null character at the end of the value, so long as the character
 * replaced is put back before running another search.
 *
 *     result = JSON_Search(buf, bufLength, key, keyLength, '.',
 *                          value, valueLength);
 *     if( result == JSONSuccess )
 *     {
 *         char save = value[valueLength];
 *         value[valueLength] = '\0';
 *         printf("Found: %s -> %s\n", key, value);
 *         value[valueLength] = save;

 * #JSONIllegalDocument if the buffer contents are NOT valid JSON;
 * #JSONMaxDepthExceeded if object and array nesting exceeds a threshold;
 * #JSONNotFound if the queryKey is NOT found.
 *
 * @note The maximum nesting depth may be specified by defining the macro
 * JSON_MAX_DEPTH.  The default is 32 of sizeof(char).
 *
 * @note JSON_Search() performs validation, but stops upon finding a matching
 * key and its value.  To validate the entire JSON document, use JSON_Validate().
