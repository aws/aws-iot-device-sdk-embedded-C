@brief Queue and linked list data structures and functions. <br><br>

This library provides queue and linked list data structures which other libraries use for organizing data. Features of this library include:
- Double-ended notification queue that may also function as a doubly-linked list.
- Simple doubly-linked list.
- Queues and lists may hold any data types.

@section queue_vs_list Queue vs List
@brief Comparison between #AwsIotQueue_t and #AwsIotList_t.

This library provides two similar data structures, #AwsIotQueue_t (queue) and #AwsIotList_t (list).

#AwsIotQueue_t is a double-ended "notify queue" that can create threads to process queued data. It may also be searched linearly, allowing it to function as a doubly-linked list. All functions that operate on an #AwsIotQueue_t provide thread safety.

#AwsIotList_t implements a simpler doubly-linked list for storing data. It requires less memory than an #AwsIotQueue_t. However, unlike #AwsIotQueue_t, most of its functions do not provide thread safety. Only @ref list_function_removeallmatches provides thread safety. For all other list functions, #AwsIotList_t.mutex must be locked before the function call if thread safety is required.

A comparison of these two data structures is below.

Data searching              | No in-place searches. Data can only be [search-and-removed.](@ref queue_function_removefirstmatch) | [Search function](@ref list_function_findfirstmatch) does not remove data.
Data removal                | [Remove tail (FIFO)](@ref queue_function_removetail), [search and remove first matching data](@ref queue_function_removefirstmatch), or [search and remove all matching data](@ref queue_function_removeallmatches). | Remove data <i>after</i> [searching](@ref list_function_findfirstmatch) or [search and remove all matching data.](@ref list_function_removeallmatches)

Currently, the queue library has the following dependencies:
- The [platform thread management component](@ref platform_threads) for creating notification threads when data is [inserted into a queue](@ref queue_function_inserthead). The queue library also depends on the mutexes provided by this component.

@section AWS_IOT_QUEUE_ENABLE_ASSERTS
@brief Set this to `1` to perform sanity checks when using queues and lists.

Asserts are useful for debugging, but should be disabled in production code. If this is set to `1`, @ref AwsIotQueue_Assert can be defined to set the assert function; otherwise, the standard library's [assert](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/assert.html) function will be used.

@configpossible `0` (asserts disabled) or `1` (asserts enabled)<br>
@configrecommended `1` when debugging; `0` in production code.<br>
@configdefault `0`

@section AwsIotQueue_Assert
@brief Assertion function used when @ref AWS_IOT_QUEUE_ENABLE_ASSERTS is `1`.

@configpossible Any function with the same signature as the standard library's [assert](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/assert.html) function.<br>
@configdefault Standard library [assert](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/assert.html) function if @ref AWS_IOT_QUEUE_ENABLE_ASSERTS is `1`; otherwise, nothing.
