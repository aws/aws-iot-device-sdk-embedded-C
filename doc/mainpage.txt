/**
@mainpage Overview
@brief C SDK providing secured connections to the AWS IoT platform. <br><br>

The AWS IoT Device SDK for C is a collection of [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99) source files that allow applications to securely connect to the AWS IoT platform. It includes an [MQTT 3.1.1 client](../mqtt/index.html), as well as libraries specific to AWS IoT, such as [Thing Shadows](../shadow/index.html). It is distributed in source form and may be build into firmware along with application code.

Design goals of this SDK include:
- <b>Configurability</b> <br>
  Each library in this SDK has <i>Configuration Settings</i> that allow it to be tailored to systems ranging from microcontrollers to desktop computers.
- <b>Portability</b> <br>
  All system calls go through a lightweight portability layer to allow this SDK to be easily ported to many systems. See [platform layer](../platform/index.html) for a list of functions that must be ported.

@section IOT_CONFIG_FILE
@brief Configuration header for the libraries in this SDK.

Define a file to be included in all library source files before any other files. Unlike other settings, this one must be set using a compiler option, such as `-D` for gcc. The option should specify a filename that is in the include path; for example, `-DIOT_CONFIG_FILE="iot_config.h"` (quotes may need to be escaped for some compilers).

@configpossible A string representing a file name. This file must be in the compiler's include path.<br>
@configdefault None. A configuration header will not be used if this value is undefined.

@section IOT_LOG_LEVEL_GLOBAL
@brief Set a default log level.

Any libraries that do not define a log level will use this setting. If a both a global log level and a library log level are defined, the library log level overrides the global one.

@configpossible One of the @ref logging_constants_levels.<br>
@configdefault @ref IOT_LOG_NONE

@section IOT_STATIC_MEMORY_ONLY
@brief Set this to `1` to disable the usage of dynamic memory allocation ([malloc](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/malloc.html) and [free](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/free.html)) throughout the libraries in this SDK.

When dynamic memory allocation is disabled, all of the memory allocation functions used in the libraries must be re-implemented. See each library's <i>Configuration/Memory allocation</i> section for a list of functions that must be re-implemented for that library.

@configpossible `0` (dynamic memory allocation enabled) or `1` (dynamic memory allocation disabled)<br>
@configrecommended `0`<br>
@configdefault `0`

@attention This settings has no effect on system calls or third-party libraries; it may also have no effect on [platform layer] (@ref platform) implementations.

@section IOT_DEMO_SECURED_CONNECTION
@brief Determines if the demos default to a TLS-secured connection with the remote host.

When this setting is `true`, all demo applications will use a TLS-secured connection by default. The default credentials for connections are @ref IOT_DEMO_ROOT_CA, @ref IOT_DEMO_CLIENT_CERT, and @ref IOT_DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY. Any connection with AWS IoT must be secured.

In demo applications, the default secured connection setting can be overridden using the command line options `-s` or `-u`. Neither of these command line options have an argument, and only one of the two should be used at a time. Passing `-s` will cause the demo application to use a secured connection, and passing `-u` will cause the demo application to use an unsecured connection.

@configpossible `true` (secured connection) or `false` (unsecured connection) <br>
@configrecommended When using the demo applications with AWS IoT, connections must be secured. Therefore, the recommended value for this setting is `true`. <br>
@configdefault If this setting is undefined <i>and</i> neither `-s` nor `-u` are passed as command line options, then any connections will be unsecured.

@section IOT_DEMO_SERVER
@brief The default remote host to use in the demos.

All demo applications will open TCP connections to this host. When using the demos with AWS IoT, this should be set to the AWS account's custom IoT endpoint. This custom endpoint can be found under the <i>Settings</i> tab of the AWS IoT console. It has a format of `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`, where `ABCDEFG1234567` is a placeholder subdomain and `us-east-2` is the region.

In demo applications, the default server can be overridden using the command line option `-h`. The command line option will override this setting.

<b>No default value is provided for this setting.</b> If this setting is undefined and no command line option `-h` is given to the demo application, the demo will fail.

@configpossible Any string representing a hostname, such as
- `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`
- `192.168.1.1`
- `localhost`

@section IOT_DEMO_PORT
@brief The default remote port to use in the demos.

All demo applications will open TCP connections to @ref IOT_DEMO_SERVER on this port. When using the demos with AWS IoT, this should be set to either `443` or `8883`.  Port `8883` provides a standard encrypted MQTT connection, while port `443` provides a secured MQTT connection using [ALPN](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/02/aws-iot-core-now-supports-mqtt-connections-with-certificate-based-client-authentication-on-port-443/).

In demo applications, the default server port may be overridden using the command line option `-p`. The command line option will override this setting.

<b>No default value is provided for this setting.</b> If this setting is undefined and no command line option `-p` is given to the demo application, the demo will fail.

@configpossible Any positive integer below `65536`.<br>
@configrecommended When using the demo applications with AWS IoT, port `443` is recommended.

@section IOT_DEMO_ROOT_CA
@brief The path to the default trusted server root certificate to use in the demos.

A trusted server root certificate only needs to be set for [secured connections](@ref IOT_DEMO_SECURED_CONNECTION). See [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/managing-device-certs.html) for more information about AWS IoT server certificates.

In demo applications, the default trusted server root certificate can be overridden using the command line option `-r`. The command line option will override this setting.

<b>No default value is provided for this setting.</b> If this setting is undefined and no command line option `-r` is given to a demo application using a secured connection, the demo will fail.

@configpossible Any string representing a filesystem path to a PEM-encoded trusted server root certificate. <br>
@configrecommended When using the demo applications with AWS IoT, one of [these root certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/managing-device-certs.html#server-authentication) should be used.

@section IOT_DEMO_CLIENT_CERT
@brief The path to the default client certificate to use in the demos.

A client certificate only needs to be set for [secured connections](@ref IOT_DEMO_SECURED_CONNECTION). See [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device-certificate.html) for a tutorial on how to set up client certificates with AWS IoT.

In demo applications, the default client certificate can be overridden with the command line option `-c`. The command line option will override this setting.

<b>No default value is provided for this setting.</b> If this setting is undefined and no command line option `-c` is given to a demo application using a secured connection, the demo will fail.

@configpossible Any string representing a filesystem path to a PEM-encoded client certificate.

@section IOT_DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY
@brief The path to the default client certificate private key to use in the demos.

A client certificate private key only needs to be set for [secured connections](@ref IOT_DEMO_SECURED_CONNECTION). This private key must match the [client certificate](@ref IOT_DEMO_CLIENT_CERT).

In demo applications, the default client certificate private key can be overridden with the command line option `-k`. The command line option will override this setting.

<b>No default value is provided for this setting.</b> If this setting is undefined and no command line option `-k` is given to a demo application using a secured connection, the demo will fail.

@configpossible Any string representing a filesystem path to a PEM-encoded private key matching the [client certificate](@ref IOT_DEMO_CLIENT_CERT).

@section AWS_IOT_DEMO_THING_NAME
@brief Default Thing Name used for demos specific to AWS IoT.

Thing Names are used to manage devices in AWS IoT. See [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-thing-management.html) for more information.

In demo applications, the default Thing Name can be overridden with the command line option `-i`. The command line option will override this setting.

<b>No default value is provided for this setting.</b> For demos requiring a Thing Name (such as Shadow) this setting must be defined (or a command line option `-i` given to the demo application); otherwise, the demo will fail.

This setting does not affect the MQTT demo (which is not specific to AWS IoT); see @ref IOT_DEMO_MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER for the equivalent setting for the MQTT demo.

@configpossible Any string representing an AWS IoT Thing Name.
