/**
@page migration Migration Guide
@brief Migration guide from C SDK version 2 or 3 to version 4.

Version 4 of the C SDK is a new design, and therefore NOT backwards compatible with previous versions. The pages below provide instructions on migrating from version 2 or 3 to version 4.

In these pages, <i>v3</i> refers to both previous versions 2 and 3, which are largely compatible with each other.
- @subpage migration_platform <br>
  Migrating @ref platform from v3 to v4. This must be done before any other component.
- @subpage migration_mqtt <br>
  Migrating an [MQTT](@ref mqtt) application from v3 to v4.
- @subpage migration_shadow <br>
  Migrating a [Shadow](@ref shadow) application from v3 to v4.
- @subpage migration_jobs <br>
  Migrating a [Jobs](@ref jobs) application from v3 to v4.
