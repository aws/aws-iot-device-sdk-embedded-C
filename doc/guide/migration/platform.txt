@page migration_platform Platform layer
@brief How to migrate the platform layer from v3 to v4.

The platform layer provides portability across different operating systems. Both v3 and v4 provide a POSIX port as an example. If you are running on a v3 application on a POSIX system, you can switch the to provided v4 POSIX port and skip this page. This guide is intended for applications running on other operating systems that would like to move their porting layer from v3 to v4.

@section migration_platform_mutex Mutex
@brief How to migrate the mutex type from v3 to v4.

The mutexes used in v3 and v4 implement the same interface. In v4, recursive mutexes must be supported.

The table below shows the equivalent mutex types for v3 and v4.

@section migration_platform_timer Timer
@brief Differences between v3 and v4 timers.

The timers in v4 are more efficient than v3, but their interface is completely different. In v4, the timer interface is designed to be similar to the timer APIs provided by most operating systems.

Because of the differences between the timers in v3 and v4, it is not possible to migrate a v3 timer implementation to v4. Therefore, a new timer implementation will need to be written for v4. See @ref platform_clock_functions for the list of functions that need to be implemented.

@section migration_platform_semaphore Semaphores
@brief Details about counting semaphores needed in v4.

Counting semaphores are a new addition to the platform layer in v4. They were not present in v3. See the IotSemaphore functions in @ref platform_threads_functions for the list of functions that need to be implemented.

@section migration_platform_network Networking
@brief How to migrate the network implementation for v3 to v4.

The networking functions are similar between v3 and v4. However, v4 requires some additional function to be implemented.

The networking component requires a type to provide credentials for secured connections. The table below shows the equivalent credentials type for v3 and v4.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Version 3</th>
        <th>Version 4</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>TLSDataParams</td>
        <td>_IotNetworkCredentials_t</td>
        <td>v4 provides @ref IotNetworkCredentials as a struct that satisfies most use cases.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Declare in file</td>
        <td>network_platform.h</td>
        <td>iot_config.h</td>
        <td>
            In v3, the credentials type <i>must</i> be declared in a file called network_platform.h.
            <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/blob/0da87f06f1501fad7b03b5d89a1322cc8a8848b4/platform/linux/mbedtls/network_platform.h">Link to sample</a>
            <br>
            In v4, we recommend declaring the credentials type in iot_config.h.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Version 4 requires two additional types to be declared:
- `_IotNetworkServerInfo_t` which provides data on the remote server. @ref IotNetworkServerInfo should satisfy most use cases.
- `_IotNetworkConnection_t` to represent the handle of a network connection. This should be an opaque handle.

@subsection migration_platform_networking_interface Interface
@brief Equivalent functions of the networking interface between v3 and v4.

The following functions should be implemented for networking:
- v3: See functions in <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/blob/0da87f06f1501fad7b03b5d89a1322cc8a8848b4/include/network_interface.h">network_interface.h</a>
- v4: Functions in @ref platform_network_functions

The table below shows the equivalent functions in v3 and v4.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Version 3</th>
        <th>Version 4</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>iot_tls_init</td>
        <td><i>Platform-specific init functions</i></td>
        <td>
            The v4 networking interface does not define a function that must be implemented to initialize the network, as some network stacks do not require initialization. It may be implemented if needed.<br><br>
            The parameters of iot_tls_init have been moved to @ref platform_network_function_create.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>iot_tls_connect</td>
        <td>@ref platform_network_function_create</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>iot_tls_write</td>
        <td>@ref platform_network_function_send</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>iot_tls_read</td>
        <td>@ref platform_network_function_receive</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>iot_tls_disconnect</td>
        <td>@ref platform_network_function_close</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>iot_tls_destroy</td>
        <td>@ref platform_network_function_destroy</td>
        <td>In v3, this function destroys the entire network stack.<br>In v4, this function only destroys the connection passed to it.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Version 4 has the following new functions that must be implemented:
- @ref platform_network_function_setreceivecallback
- @ref platform_network_function_setclosecallback

Version 4 requires the networking functions to be given as an @ref IotNetworkInterface_t. We recommend implementing a function that returns the @ref IotNetworkInterface_t containing the networking functions.
